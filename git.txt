(need to do the git clone step(s) first)

(in git dir)
git config credential.helper cache

git config -l

git clone https://github.com/hovetaut/RPB

cd RPB

git remote -v     //should shoe 2 

git remote add upstream https://github.com/hovetaut/RPB 

now it remote -v will show 4

git fetch upstream

git checkout master

git checkout -b inprogress

git pull                      //doesn't do anything with branches

git pull upstream inprogress     // (remote, branch)  this does pull down files in branch (probably have to be committred ) 

? what is fetch versus  pull ?     (maybe hint:  fetch appears in git remote -v )
