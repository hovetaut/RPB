merging branches:  merge "with" branch x means merge commits from x into the current branch.
(x will still be behind current branch if that's all you do.)

version A


(need to do the git clone step(s) first)
cd git
 !! don't do this !!    cd rpb
git init
git config --global user.name rbye
git config --global user.email hovetaut@gmail.com
(in git dir)
git config credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
git config -l

(the examplles of doing the clone with "git clone username@host:/path/to/repository" don't seem to  have it right.)
on github, In the right sidebar of your fork's repository page, click (clipboard icon with <-  arrow)to copy the clone URL for your fork. 
then paste it into the git clone cmd: 
git clone https://github.com/hovetaut/RPB.git
or maybe:
git clone https://github.com/hovetaut/RPB

git remote -v     //should shoe 2 

git remote add upstream https://github.com/hovetaut/RPB 

now it remote -v will show 4

git fetch upstream

git checkout master

git checkout -b inprogress

git pull                      //doesn't do anything with branches

git pull upstream inprogress     // (remote, branch)  this does pull down files in branch (probably have to be committred ) 
    is this is willing to overwrite?

? what is fetch versus  pull ?     (maybe hint:  fetch appears in git remote -v )

git add <filename>       // (or *)  adds files to index (staging area)

in open source progects, the server with the central repo is usally called "origin", 
and your fork of it (e.g. on github) is called "upstream"
